    <h3>How to Subscribe</h3><br/><br/>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
        Pump Manager Pro currently has not started to offer online payment.<br/>
        All payment for subscription should be made via bank teller.<br/><br/>
        Visit any GTBank and pay with the following details :<br/><br/>
        Account name: Enabled Systems Technology (pump manager pro).<br/>
        Account Number: xxxxxxxxxx<br/>
        Payee: -Your username-<br/>
        tel No.: -mobile number associated with your pmp account-<br/><br/>

    <h3>How much to pay?</h3><br/><br/>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
        At present, Pump Manager Pro bills you per day.<br/>
        Cost for a day is <strong>[ 335 Naira ]</strong>.<br/>
        So do the math and pay for as many days as you want.<br/><br/>
        <h6>Cool tip</h6>
        <p style="font-size: 10px;">
            If you pay a little more than what you are supposed to pay for the<br/>
            number of days you intended, pump manager pro will be generous enough<br/>
            to add one additional day to your account.<br/>
            E.g. I want 30days subscription which should amount to<br/>
                <strong>30 x 335 = 10,050 naira</strong><br/>
                instead i paid with an additional 5 naira which is :  10,055 naira<br/>
                pump manager pro will credit me with 31days instead of 30days.<br/>
                Make sure you take advantage of this cool stuff. <strong>:)</strong><br/><br/>

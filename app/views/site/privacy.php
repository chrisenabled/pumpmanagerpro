                        and security measures.

                If PumpManagerPro becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets,

                We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched

                We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,

                We restrict access to personal information to PMP employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate,
                develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline,
                including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

                PMP processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any
                applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect,
                store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal
                information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct
                their personal information whenever necessary.

            <h5>Accessing and updating personal information</h5>
            <p class="leftunitpadding">
                When you use PMP services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this
                data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business
                purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing
                such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort,
                jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes),
                or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge,
                except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal
                information. We provide the details for these procedures in the FAQs for these services.

            <h5>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h5>
            <p class="leftunitpadding">
                Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit
                consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are
                significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).
                Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.
